        Hey everyone!
<br><br>
The first thing that came to our mind when we heard about the suspension of classes was "Yayy Vacays!". But 3 days into it, we realized that it's just gonna get more and more boring. So we decided to fast track SoC so that you can begin learning right now, and kill the boredom. We will be contacting mentors to shortlist mentees as soon as possible and get started with the learning phase.
