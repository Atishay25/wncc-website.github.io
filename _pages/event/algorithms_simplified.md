        Hello all,
<br><br>
WnCC proudly presents Algorithms Simplified. This is a series where we do not require you to code. You can just watch a 15 minute video to learn something cool, thatâ€™s it! Every Friday, we will be sharing short videos trivially explaining some mind-blowing yet intuitive algorithms, along with optional tasks for those who want to code and implement those algorithms in a Dive Deep section as well.
