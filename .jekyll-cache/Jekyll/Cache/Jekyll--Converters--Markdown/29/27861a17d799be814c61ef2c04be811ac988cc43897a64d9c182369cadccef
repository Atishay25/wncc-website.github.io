        Hello all,
<br /><br />
After a very successful event on Introduction to Competitive Programming, WnCC brought to all beginners an opportunity to compete in a programming contest in an unconventional way. People enjoyed the thrill of battling each other in this game of wits called CodeGames. The only pre-requisites for this contest were logic, C++, problem solving skills and enthusiasm. It was a beginner friendly contest created to help everyone get into the fun world of competitive programming.

<br /><br />
You can watch the introductory session for this contest on YouTube
