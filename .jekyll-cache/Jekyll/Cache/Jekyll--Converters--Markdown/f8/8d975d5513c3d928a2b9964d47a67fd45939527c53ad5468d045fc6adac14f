        Description: The selected students will work together to build the Anime Club IITB website from scratch using django. We are planning the website to have a news board which will give information about coming events/quizzes, an anonymous chat board, an anime ratings and recommendation page, etc. The students are free to suggest their own ideas. In the proposal the students have to submit their motivation as well as their vision for the project. The students are suggested to read up a bit about HTML/CSS by themselves.
