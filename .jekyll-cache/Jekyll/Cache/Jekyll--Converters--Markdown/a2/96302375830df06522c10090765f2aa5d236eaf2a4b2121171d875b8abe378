        Description:
        
        Did you just sleep while watching a lecture and are too lazy to watch it again? Do you think a 1 hour lecture could be done away in like 10-20 mins? Or you really wanted to attend a webinar but do not have the patience to listen to the speaker for 2-3 hours?
  <br /><br />

        Don’t worry! BriefKing has got you covered! Briefking is an attempt to automate the day-to-day stuff that you do. The Input to this application will be “your daily class lectures” and the expected output is a brief but detailed summary of the entire lecture. This is more of a Research and Development Project. You can expect reading a lot of research papers and then implement a suitable model while keeping in mind the accuracy. We will not go deep into the topics rather it will be more of an implementation based project.
