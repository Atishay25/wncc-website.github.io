        The aim of this project is to train students who aim to do well at ICPC regionals. We will be covering a wide variety of content in Competitive Programming, and we will be asking you to participate in certain competitions in which we will discuss individual performances to understand where you need to improve to take yourself to the next level.
        <br /><br />
        We are planning to take a small batch size, so that the content is tailored individually according to your strengths and weaknesses. At the end, we expect a short report of around 3-4 pages detailing what we went through in the entire program. The time requirement for this program will be somewhat high, since ICPC regionals are in May and the goal of this program is to prepare you for that. Bare minimum requirement: Have been 
        <strong>1600+</strong> rating on codeforces before the beginning of the program.
        <br /><br />
