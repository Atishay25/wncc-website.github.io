        Decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, is a system in which users can access financial products directly on a decentralized blockchain network, without the need for middlemen such as banks and brokerages. Democratizing finance by replacing centralized institutions such as banks with direct, peer-to-peer relationships is the way to go. Every financial service we use today -- savings, loans, insurance and much more -- could one day exist on a blockchain, not in a bank. 

        This project is focused on Launching a Token on a chain of your choice with a fixed supply and a notional value. A coin has its own blockchain, while a token is built on a pre-existing network. Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchains for their security and decentralized nature.
        The project would involve learning blockchain native languages such as Solidity to develop smart contracts. It would also involve designing the Tokenomics of the currency that we would create. Tokenomics are the economics that govern your crypto, like total supply, distribution method, and initial pricing.
