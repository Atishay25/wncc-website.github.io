        Tech Points is a concept to streamline the process of prizes distribution.
Each club will, in place of tech vouchers, give certain tech points to the winners. These winners can redem these points at any time of the year to get any prize from the list of prizes we provide mapped to tech points. Our task is to create a portal where students can check their tech points along with appropriate history, give them a redemming option as well as show the stage their current redemmed prize are in, maintain a backend whose access will be restricted to club managers, nominees and GS to allot tech points and provide prizes when redemmed by users.
