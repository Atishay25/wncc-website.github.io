        "Web 3 is an internet owned by users and builders orchestrated with tokens." - Chris Dixon

        As the craze for the blockchain, web3 and NFTs is increasing exponentially, the aim of this project is to introduce the amazing new world of web 3.0 in a completely hands-on manner. In this project the mentees will be able to appreciate the amount of ease, freedom and transparency blockchain and decentralization is bringing in the world right now. You will get the hands-on experience of coding web3 applications aka dApps from scratch.
        Some of the projects you will be building along the way...
        1. Crypto based crowdfunding app
        2. Make your own NFT
        3. NFT minting 
        4. DeFi apps
