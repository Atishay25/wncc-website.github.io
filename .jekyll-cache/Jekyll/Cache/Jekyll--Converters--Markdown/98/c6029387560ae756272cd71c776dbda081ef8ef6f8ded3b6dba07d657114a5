        Hey everyone!
<br /><br />
Seasons of Code is a programme launched by the WnCC, along the lines of GSoC without much greenery though. The incentive is similar to ITSP, based on the current form of it, the fundamental difference is that one can choose from the ideas offered by mentors who are senior undergrads, doctorate students or professors, and in some exceptional cases, startups. SoC generally has a long timeframe though, from April to July, extending this programme into a mentorship of sorts into the semester.
It is not just about development by the way. We also have some mentors who take up programmes regarding competitive coding and scientific computation too. Seasons of Code gives you an amazing opportunity to learn and dive into coding under the mentorship of the best in our institute.
