<br />
Growing up, I always dreamt of becoming a software guy working for some massive SAAS company in Silicon Valley, but it was just a distant dream. As for my first year in college, I had absolutely no idea of what I should make of my stay here. I kinda knew I had no intention of pursuing Chemical.

<br />
It was quite accidental I'd say. It all started when the pandemic hit. All of a sudden I was locked in my room, with no college, no hanging out with friends, and basically nothing to do. With a ton of free time at hand, I began exploring various things: design, music and coding among others.
<br /><br />

I saw a youtube video by Rachit Jain about how he got good at coding / landed an internship at Microsoft despite not being from CSE. He talked about this thing called Competitive Programming (aka CP), and how it got him addicted to coding. In May 2020 I too decided to give it a try. By June, I was hooked on it and decided to stop wasting time elsewhere (social media, etc) and focus full time on getting good at competitive coding. Back then, only a handful of my batchmates used to do CP. Every time I used to get stuck, I had no one to turn to. This greatly improved my Googling and debugging skills. I would read the editorials and even ask questions on the CodeChef/Codeforces forums. By October, I was highly rating obsessed and realised I wasn't learning anything new. I was at the end of my 3rd Sem at this point in time and had no winter internship. So I decided to change my strategy, and try and master some new algorithms during my winter break. I would take up a new topic every week from November till Jan, and attempt a shit ton of questions related to that topic.
<br /><br />
After this, we approached Problem G, which was an optimization task. We were unable to get anywhere with the problem for around 30 minutes. I tried out another geometry problem (Problem F) while Shubham tried a puzzle kind of problem (Problem A). However, seeing the submissions on Problem G increasing, we decided to go back to it. This time we started discussing our thoughts on the problem. Instead of using headphones, we were shouting through the plastic divider between us xD! We split the problem into 8 cases and formalized the algorithm for each case. For this, we required 6 segment trees and 2 merge sort trees, which is just repulsive to think about! Being the data structure guy of the team, it was up to me to code this. Shubham again moved on to Problem A, leaving me around 80 minutes to code this problem. Out of sheer laziness of coding another lengthy task, I spent 10 minutes thinking of some alternate solution. I thought of an idea by which I was able to reduce 1 of the cases into a 1 line code, and similarly, all the cases followed. It ended up being only a 10 line code and we got our 5th AC on the 247th minute! Shubham had begun coding problem A and we had our 6th AC on the 268th minute! Having around 30 minutes left to the end of the contest, we approached problem J together, Shubham tried an approach using flows, and I used DP. We were unable to formalize anything and I moved on to the geometry problem (Problem F). 10 minutes to the end of the contest I got a rough idea of the logic behind the problem. However, seeing the timer we stopped, as 10 minutes is orders of magnitude less than the time required to even code a geometry problem. There was a countdown again during the last 10 seconds of the contest, and the contest ended!

<br />
Submissions for the last hour are not visible to the participants, and so everyone had to wait for the official results which were declared during the closing ceremony. Our team ended up with a World Rank of 33, and 2nd out of the 8 teams from India. It has been the best performance by IIT Bombay in the history of ICPC! 
<br />
The most memorable moment during the closing ceremony was when the World Champions were declared; they received a standing ovation for a prolonged period as everyone paid homage to how hard and long the champions had worked for this moment.
