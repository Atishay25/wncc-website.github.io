        The goal of this project is to implement 3D Convolutional Neural Network models for predicting the directional movement of stock markets using data from various sources.
Main Paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417419301915
Other Articles: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/08/hands-on-stock-price-time-series-forecasting-using-deep-convolutional-networks/, https://machinelearningmastery.com/using-cnn-for-financial-time-series-prediction/, will be sharing resources for learning the foundations, mentees can also find more articles on the internet, and look up papers &amp; data on the Indian market as well and try working on them.			
        <br />
Prerequisite:
Should be familiar with python and exposure to data analysis is preferable
