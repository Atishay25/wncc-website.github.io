        The end goal is to deploy a RL based agent for automated stock trading.
        <br /><br />
        Reinforcement learning might sound exotic and advanced, but the underlying concept of this technique is quite simple. In fact, everyone knows about it since childhood!
        <br /><br />
        As a kid, you were always given a reward for excelling in sports or studies. Also, you were reprimanded or scolded for doing something mischievous like breaking a vase. This was a way to change your behaviour. Suppose you would get a bicycle or PlayStation for coming first, you would practice a lot to come first. And since you knew that breaking a vase meant trouble, you would be careful around it. This is called reinforcement learning.
        <br /><br />
        The reward served as positive reinforcement while the punishment served as negative reinforcement. In this manner, your elders shaped your learning. In a similar way, the RL algorithm can learn to trade in financial markets on its own by looking at the rewards or punishments received for the actions.
        <br /><br />
        In the realm of trading, the problem can be stated in multiple ways such as to maximise profit, reduce drawdowns, or portfolio allocation. The RL algorithm will learn the strategy to maximise long-term rewards.
        <br /><br />
        A quote sums it up perfectly, ‚ÄúAlphaZero, a reinforcement learning algorithm developed by Google‚Äôs DeepMind AI, taught us that we were playing chess wrong!‚Äù
        <br /><br />
        The project would involve reading up about RL, doing some simple assignments on it, learning about stocks and market, and then applying RL techniques for trading. Enthusiasm in stock markets, AI/RL and willingness to spend time and effort is the only pre-requisite. However having any knowledge/experience about the mentioned topics might help, so mention it in the proposal. If you don‚Äôt have any prior background in these fields, write about your general skills, programming languages you are comfortable in, and other things you find relevant. Keep the proposal short and crisp. Also in your proposal, mention your brief understanding of the below article (1 page max)
