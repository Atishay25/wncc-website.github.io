<p class="blog-content blog-higlight" style="font-size:1.9em; color: aliceblue"><strong>Hey all! I am Kunind Sahu, a BTech thirdie (a to-be fourthie) in the MEMS department. I am pursuing a dual minor in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from CMInDS, IIT Bombay. You’d often see me making bad jokes, and then laughing at them. But (un) fortunately, I’m here to talk about my path to the role of an Analyst Intern in the Credit Fraud and Risk - Centre of Excellence at American Express, this summer!

<br />
I did not spend my first year doing a lot of things. However, it was during the COVID-19 period after my second semester had abruptly ended, during which I learnt quite a lot of things from various online sources.
<br />
Since CS101 for me ran in the spring sem, it was cut-off: so I first began to learn the remaining part of CS101 through CDEEP (also did MA108 through CDEEP and other resources so that my math fundamentals for further courses are clear - though you don’t really need differential equations for machine learning).
<br />
Then, I began by learning Python (since it was being used everywhere) and all the associated libraries for data science, namely, numpy, pandas and matplotlib. Once I had all the basics in place, I began my ML journey by doing this awesome introductory course ‘Machine Learning’ by Andrew Ng on Coursera. Although the programming assignments were in MATLAB, I found a Python version of the assignments, where you write code on Jupyter Notebooks instead and submit them the same way you’d submit the MATLAB assignments. You can find the Python version of the assignments <a href="https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments">here</a>. Also, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QtJKyo-CmdIulT5cNh_k2_j4R8-Mszb9/view?usp=sharing">here is the link</a> to my notes for Andrew Ng’s course and cheatsheet for Python libraries for machine learning.
<br />
I did apply for a few WnCC SoC projects, but wasn’t selected for either one of them. I did do a few other courses related to Finance. 

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #55cfff; font-size: 45px">Programming Experience untill 2nd year summers</span>
<br />
I had some coding experience before coming to the institute through school. We were taught introductory programming (roughly equivalent to the pre-midsem part of CS101) in Java as a part of our ICSE curriculum - that really helped me get enthusiastic about the field as a whole. That, and the online courses (especially the application oriented programming assignments of the coursera Machine Learning course) I did during my summers, really motivated me about programming - more specifically in the area of machine learning.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #55cfff; font-size: 45px">Projects or Internships</span>
<br />
I did do quite a few course projects through the courses I was doing as a part of the CMInDS minor, apart from those two, I did a summer research internship at TU Delft (during the summers after my 4th sem). Additionally, I also did a project through WnCC SoC in the area of reinforcement learning.
<br />
<br />
DS203 - The project was supposed to be done in groups. My team and I made a project on the analysis of a bank marketing campaign where we employed tools from all the four pipelines (Exploratory, Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive) of data science - to predict if the campaign would be successful and ways or actions to be employed to improve it.
<br /><br />
DS303 - Again a group project: we employed various machine learning algorithms to detect credit card fraud. Here, we tried to focus much more on machine learning aspects of data science . This project coincidentally overlapped a lot with what AmEx was hiring interns for, in my year. Consequently, this project was discussed the most in my AmEx interview! 
<br /><br />
Summer Research Internship @ TU Delft - I got an opportunity to intern @ TU Delft at their MACHINA Lab (TU Delft has 16 labs dedicated specifically to AI and its applications ;) ). There, I worked on the topic of Graph Similarity Computation through Deep Learning. This is where I was first exposed to the nascent field of Graph Machine Learning (which has turned into an interest now!). To give you an idea of the awesome work being done there. My guide, Prof. Miguel Bessa, used machine learning to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWTWHhMAu7I">make a super-compressible metamaterial from a brittle base material</a> . Additionally, one of his PostDoc students used Bayesian Optimization and created the world’s most precise microchip sensor using a spiderweb as an inspiration! I got the internship through apping. I’ve written extensively about the process of apping right here. 
<br /><br />
WnCC SoC Project - My project was on the topic of reinforcement learning. There, we used reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning (and also the Expectimax algorithm as a heuristic to serve as a baseline) to train an intelligent agent to play the game of 2048.

<br />
3rd sem &amp; Winter: CP
<br />
4th sem &amp; Summer: ML / Deep Learning / CV
<br />
5th sem: Full Stack Web Dev
<br />
6th sem: Same as 5th sem + Explored Crypto + Game dev a little.
<br />

<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #55cfff; font-size: 45px">Intern Season</span>
<br />
I had made up my mind a year back, and only applied for the software-related companies, a majority of which didn't open for Chemical. Out of the 5 companies I applied to, day 1 got me 0 selections. I was mentally prepared for this. The next company I was allowed to apply for was Sprinklr, and I was able to get a test shortlist. The test was 3h long, and I was able to solve 2.5 of the 3 questions. Anyone who solved 2+ questions was shortlisted for the interview. After 3 Technical (1 - 1.5h each) and 1 HR interview (30mins) rounds of interviews, I managed to get selected.
<br />
<br />
Interview experience (Tech Rounds)
<br />
1) Previous internship learnings.
<br />
2) Some projects from my resume.
<br />
3) My understanding of the tech used in my projects/interns. For example, why did I choose a particular web framework like React or why did I need a database or a cache.
<br />
4) DSA Topics: Some knowledge about how C++ Data Structures actually work, like set and map (AVL Trees, RB Trees) and their unordered versions (Hash Maps)
<br />
5) Solving a few DSA questions on Google Docs (No IDE autocompletions, so practice this!).
<br />
6) Some puzzles and logic questions.
<br />
7) A little knowledge about how the internet works.
Since I had some React experience. I had to design some components and custom React hooks.
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #55cfff; font-size: 45px">Protips for the Interview</span>
<br />
Right off the bat suggest/implement the brute force solution (even if you know a better solution exists). Then walk the interviewer through how you can optimize various things and suggest a better solution.
Also practice extensively with one language of your choice, I'd suggest C++. Closer to your interview, practise solving questions on Google Docs / Note Pad (No autocompletions)
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #55cfff; font-size: 45px">Mistakes Committed</span>
<br />
A ton. Here's what I've learnt:
<br />
a) Read, think, implement, repeat. Focus on implementing things hands-on, rather than just watching tutorial videos.
<br />
b) If you want to stay in the game long enough to get noticed then dream big. Most people tend to float away once they've accomplished their goals.
<br />
c)Start early, and work as much as you possibly can.
<br />
d) Everything is already out there. If you’re just beginning, things seem new. Stick around for a while and they become familiar.
<br />

<span style="font-weight: 900; color: #55cfff; font-size: 45px">Tips and Suggestions</span>
For CP, I'd suggest using Stopstalk to understand which problems to solve. It's a website that lets you see the problems solved by others in a sorted order. Here's my 
<a href="https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/Relaxxpls">profile</a> and you can find other instizens
<a href="https://www.stopstalk.com/leaderboard?q=Indian+Institute+of+Technology+Bombay">here</a> 
You'll still have to submit on the various sites (Codechef, codeforces, etc) individually.
I used to stalk a few seniors and follow their progress chronologically.
You can also see how my code evolved from a noob person <a href="https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/33464653">noob person</a> to a well, <a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/722/submission/103334574"> non-noob person </a>
